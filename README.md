# Giphy -- The Poorly Visual Designed Website
An animated GIF project for U of M - Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp

This project is a site that shows animated GIFs on a variety of topics. The user can search various terms in the search field which adds a 
new button/tag. When the user clicks on the tag new GIFs are loaded on the DOM. The buttons stay on the page so the user can revisit their
entry. I will add a delete button in the near future so users can remove buttons to help keep the webpage clean.
